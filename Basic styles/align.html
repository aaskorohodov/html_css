    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 500px;">
    Justify align p. To see what it does, you need to have some very long text
    that would not fit in one line:
        <br><br>
    The align="justify" attribute in HTML is used to specify the alignment of text within a block-level element. When applied to a block of text, such as a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) or a &lt;div&gt;, the justify value tells the browser to apply full justification to the text.
        <br><br>
    Full justification means that the text is aligned along both the left and right edges of the container, creating a straight edge on both sides. This is achieved by adjusting the spacing between words and characters in each line. The browser automatically stretches or compresses the spaces between words to make the lines of text evenly fill the available width.
        <br><br>
    Using align="justify" can help create a visually balanced and professional-looking layout, particularly for blocks of text that span multiple lines. However, it's worth noting that the behavior of text justification can vary across different browsers and can sometimes result in uneven or excessive spacing.
